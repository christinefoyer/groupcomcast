        </ol>
        <p>This helps prevent unauthorized access to your comcast.net email sign in inbox.</p>

        <h3>Protecting Yourself from Phishing Scams</h3>

            <li>Only logging in through official Comcast/Xfinity URLs</li>
            <li>Checking for a padlock symbol in your browser’s address bar</li>
            <li>Avoiding clicks on suspicious email links</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By being cautious, you can safeguard your personal data.</p>
